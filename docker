(optional) If you have already downloaded any image via docker pull you need to clean them first - otherwise they won't be resized

docker rmi your_image_name

Edit the storage config

vi /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage

There should be something like DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS="...", change it to DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS="... --storage-opt dm.basesize=100G"

Restart the docker deamon

service docker restart

Pull the image

docker pull your_image_name

(optional) verification

docker run -i -t your_image_name /bin/bash

df -h
